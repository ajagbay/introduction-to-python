This repository contains interactive Jupyter Notebooks introducing the basics of Python programming. This resources is a fork of my work to build an introductory Python resource guide for the Stanford University Bioengineering department in Spring 2020 (original repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/anthony-agbay/python-resource-guide)). The best way to access all of the notebooks is to visit the guide homepage at [https://walkintheforest.com/content/introduction-to-python/%F0%9F%90%8D+Introduction+to+Python](https://walkintheforest.com/content/introduction-to-python/%F0%9F%90%8D+Introduction+to+Python)
