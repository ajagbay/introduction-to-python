    "In the previous modules, we have been working with scripts that can operate own their own once they have been run. However, once you start working with more advanced scripts, you may want to start building in ways to customize their behavior based on a user's input. In fact, you have likely already seen examples of this type of behavior (albeit in a different language) when running any of the command line commands (see Working with the Command Line). Because there is a wide variety of methods for working with user inputs, this module will be the first in a series covering this topic. In this module, we will introduce:\n",

During every run through the while loop, the code will execute the `try-except` block. The code within the `try` block will be executed. If this causes an error or exception (a ValueError in our case), the code within the `except` block is run *instead of crashing the entire script*. In the example above, we will continually use `input()` to prompt the user for a valid integer.
