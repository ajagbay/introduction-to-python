    "In the previous modules, we worked with scripts that required editing the source code (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) to modify the behavior. As you expand your toolset and tackle more complex projects, you may find yourself building scripts that need to respond to various user inputs. Because there is a wide variety of methods for working with user inputs, this module will be the first in a series covering this topic. In this module, we will introduce:\n",

For our purposes, we are only interested in one particular part of the `sys` module: the `sys.argv` list.

    "\n",

    "#### Goal\n",
    "Implement `generate_description()` below using command-line arguments and fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The printed output (other than the book title and author name) should match the example string above.\n",
    "2. You do not need to worry about cases where a user passes an incorrect number of arguments\n",

    "#### Additional Notes\n",
    "- To pass multi-word strings as a command-line argument, you must wrap the string in quotes. (E.g., `\"Frank Herbert\"`)\n",

As mentioned throughout the module, the are additional methods for creating complex input parsing systems. However, the methods introduced in this module can serve almost all introductory needs.\n",
